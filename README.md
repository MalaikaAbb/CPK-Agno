# CopilotKit + Agno Test Suite

A navigable, working test harness covering every page of the CopilotKit Agno documentation — each doc page is a route that actually runs the thing it describes.

## 2. Overview

[Agno](https://docs.agno.com) is a Python agent framework. Its `AgentOS` server can expose an agent over [AG-UI](https://ag-ui.com), the event protocol CopilotKit speaks, which is what lets a React app drive an Agno agent with streaming, tool calls, and generative UI.

This repo is a **living test harness** for that integration. Each route implements what its doc page teaches — not a restatement of it. It covers a deliberately scoped subset of `https://docs.copilotkit.ai/agno`: the CLI, Build-with-agents, MCP Apps, A2UI, Intelligence Platform, Common Issues, and Migration-guide sections are intentionally out of scope and have no route. Routes that cannot work locally (licensed features, or ones needing a service this repo doesn't ship) are clearly labelled and explain exactly what's missing, rather than being faked.

Tracks: **<https://docs.copilotkit.ai/agno>**

## 3. Architecture

```
Browser (React 19)
  │  @copilotkit/react-core/v2 — CopilotKitProvider, CopilotChat, hooks
  │  POST /api/copilotkit
  ▼
Next.js 16 App Router  ·  localhost:3010
  │  Copilot Runtime  (@copilotkit/runtime)
  │  agents: { default, agno_agent } → new AgnoAgent({ url })
  │  POST http://localhost:8010/agui   ← AG-UI over SSE
  ▼
Agno AgentOS  ·  localhost:8010        ← Python / FastAPI
  │  AgentOS(agents=[agent], interfaces=[AGUI(agent=agent)])
  ▼
OpenAI  (gpt-4o by default)
```

Three points worth noting:

- **The backend for this framework is Python.** Agno is a Python library; the agent runs under `uvicorn`, not Node.
- **The runtime lives inside the Next app**, at `frontend/src/app/api/copilotkit/[[...slug]]/route.ts`. There is no third server.
- **The model key never reaches the browser.** Only the Agno process holds it, and the browser never talks to Agno directly.

## 4. Prerequisites

| Requirement                        | Version                | Notes                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js                            | 20+ (built on 24.16.0) | Next.js 16 requires 20+.                            |
| npm                                | 10+ (built on 12.0.1)  | Or pnpm/yarn/bun.                                   |
| Python                             | 3.9+ (built on 3.12.3) | Per the Agno quickstart.                            |
| [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | 0.11+                  | Used for the backend. `pip` works too.              |
| OpenAI API key                     | —                      | Required.                                           |
| CopilotKit license key             | —                      | **Optional.** Only unlocks the Rich Threads routes. |

No framework-specific CLI is required. The CopilotKit CLI (`npx copilotkit@latest`) scaffolds new projects and signs into the licensed platform; this repo is already scaffolded, so you don't need it.

## 5. Setup

**1. Clone**

```bash
git clone <this-repo> agno && cd agno
```

**2. Install frontend deps**

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

**3. Install backend deps**

```bash
cd backend && uv sync && cd ..
```

**4. Configure the environment**

```bash
cp .env.example backend/.env
```

Then edit `backend/.env`:

| Variable                             | Where                 | What it does                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`                     | `backend/.env`        | **Required.** The model key. The backend refuses to start without it.        |
| `OPENAI_MODEL`                       | `backend/.env`        | Model id. Defaults to `gpt-4o`.                                              |
| `AGENT_PORT`                         | `backend/.env`        | Agno's port. Defaults to `8000` in code; set to `8010` in `backend/.env`.                                             |
| `AGENT_CORS_ORIGINS`                 | `backend/.env`        | Origins allowed to hit the agent directly. Not needed on the normal path.    |
| `AGNO_AGENT_URL`                     | `frontend/.env.local` | Where the runtime finds the agent. Defaults to `http://localhost:8010/agui`. |
| `AGENT_URL`                          | `frontend/.env.local` | Agent server root for the routes copied from the docs' demo Code tabs (A2UI, Open Generative UI, Shared State, HITL overview, Sub-agents). Published default is `http://localhost:8000`, so **set it to `http://localhost:8010`** with the ports above, or those demos cannot reach the agent. |
| `CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY`           | `frontend/.env.local` | Server-side managed-project key. Unlocks Rich Threads. Optional.             |
| `COPILOTKIT_LICENSE_TOKEN`           | `frontend/.env.local` | Self-hosted/OSS license token only. Not issued for managed projects.         |

> Next.js does not read the repo-root `.env`. Frontend variables belong in `frontend/.env.local`. The defaults are correct for a standard local run except `AGENT_URL`, so in practice you need `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `backend/.env` and `AGENT_URL=http://localhost:8010` in `frontend/.env.local`.

**Default ports:** frontend **3010**, backend **8010**.

**5. Updating packages to latest versions (optional)**

To update dependencies to their latest versions:

- **Frontend (`frontend/`)**:

  ```bash
  cd frontend

  # Option A: Update all dependencies to latest major/minor versions
  npx npm-check-updates -u && npm install

  ```

  > **Note:** If `@ag-ui/*` packages are updated, verify the versions in the `overrides` section in `frontend/package.json` match to prevent version mismatches.

- **Backend (`backend/`)**:

  ```bash
  cd backend
  # Using uv (recommended) — upgrade uv.lock and sync:
  uv lock --upgrade ; uv sync

  ```

---

## 6. Running the project

Two processes, two terminals.

**Terminal 1 — the agent:**

```bash
cd backend
uv run main.py
```

Success looks like:

```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8010 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing it exits immediately with a message telling you so — deliberately, rather than starting and failing on the first message.

**Terminal 2 — the app:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Success looks like:

```
▲ Next.js 16.3.0 (Turbopack)
- Local:   http://localhost:3010
✓ Ready in 1.2s
```

Open **<http://localhost:3010>**. The home page probes the agent server-side and shows a connection panel — check it first if anything misbehaves.

---

## 7. What to expect — walkthrough per section

Every route shows a status badge and a link to the doc page it tests. "Pass" and "Fail" below are what a tester should look for.

### How each route is split

Routes with a live feature are split in two:

|                         |                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`<route>`**           | Notes, pass/fail criteria, and **the exact source** of the implementation, read off disk at render time. No live chat here.                        |
| **`<route>/demo-chat`** | Just the running feature, with no sidebar or page chrome — built for screen recording. Reached via the **Open demo ↗** button in the route header. |

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **The code on a page is never a re-typed approximation.** Each page reads real files from the repo (`frontend/src/lib/source.ts`), so what you compare against the doc is what actually runs. Some excerpts use `#region` markers, which stay visible in the source file and are labelled with their line numbers.
- **Demo routes share the app-wide provider**, so a conversation started in a demo continues on any other route. That's deliberate — `/custom-look-and-feel/headless-ui/demo-chat` and `/custom-look-and-feel/programmatic-control/demo-chat` show the _same_ conversation through two completely different UIs.

22 of the 28 doc routes have a demo: quickstart, prebuilt-components, the three interactive thread routes, all five Custom Look and Feel routes, display-only, tool-rendering, frontend-cards, frontend-tools, governed-actions, human-in-the-loop, both Backend routes, error-debugging, intelligence/memories, learning, and cookbook/jev-generative-ui. The other 6 have nothing to run: `/`, `/threads`, `/threads/import` and `/threads/architecture` are reference pages; `/generative-ui/your-components/interactive` is a doc page with nothing in it; `/webmcp` is tracked for drift with the demo deliberately not built (see below).

### Getting Started

**`/` — Introduction**
Orientation plus a live connection check. **Try:** load the page. **Pass:** "Agno agent" shows a green dot and `200 from http://localhost:8010/status`. **Fail:** a red dot and "unreachable" — the agent isn't running.

**`/quickstart` — Quickstart**
The minimum viable path: provider, runtime route, one chat. **Try:** `Can you tell me a joke?` **Pass:** tokens stream in one at a time and render as markdown. **Fail:** nothing streams, or an error banner appears.

### Basics

**`/prebuilt-components` — Prebuilt Components**
`CopilotChat`, `CopilotSidebar`, and `CopilotPopup` in tabs — only one mounts at a time, since the sidebar and popup both use fixed positioning. **Try:** `What is CopilotKit?`, then switch tabs. **Pass:** all three drive the same agent, and the conversation survives tab switches (one shared provider). **Fail:** a component renders blank, or the sidebar/popup never appears.

### Rich Threads — all require a license key

**`/threads` — Overview.** Reference: what threads persist and why it's an event log, not a transcript.

**`/threads/drawer` — Threads Drawer.** `CopilotThreadsDrawer` beside a chat in a shared `CopilotChatConfigurationProvider`. **Pass (licensed):** selecting a row replays that conversation with no state written by you. **Pass (unlicensed):** a _locked panel_ — that's the correct result, and proves the component mounted and detected the missing license. **Fail:** a blank area with no locked state.

**`/threads/headless` — Headless Threads.** A thread list built by hand on `useThreads`, including **rename**, which the prebuilt drawer doesn't expose. **Pass (licensed):** threads list, and rename/archive/delete take effect. **Pass (unlicensed):** an empty list with an explanatory note.

**`/threads/lifecycle` — Thread & History Lifecycle.** One button per lifecycle claim on the page, with the chat's resolved state read back from its `CopilotChatConfigurationProvider`, so the readouts are the chat's own. **Try:** send a message, press "Remount chat", then "Open conversation", "New chat", "Pin a threadId prop" and "New chat" again. **Pass:** the remount gives a new id and an empty chat; "Open conversation" returns to the first id with its messages replayed from the runtime's `InMemoryAgentRunner`; with the id pinned, "New chat" changes nothing and the amber line shows the `Ignoring startNewThread()` warning; the pinned id survives a remount. **Fail:** the re-opened thread shows 0 messages (nothing replayed). The ledger lists every id the chat has been on. See [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) #28.

**`/threads/import` — Synchronize Thread History.** Reference. Import targets ADK and LangGraph history; Agno isn't a documented source.

**`/threads/architecture` — Persistence Architecture.** Reference: replay, reconnection, auto-naming, locks.

### Custom Look and Feel

**`/custom-look-and-feel/programmatic-control`**
Drives the agent with no chat component. **Try:** type a message, press Run. **Pass:** status flips to Running, the message count climbs, tokens stream into the transcript; Stop halts it mid-stream. **Fail:** Run does nothing.

**`/custom-look-and-feel/inspector`**
The debugging overlay, mounted by the provider (never by hand — see [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md)). **Try:** send a message, open the inspector docked at the window edge. **Pass:** the event list fills, and Frontend Tools lists all four browser tools with schemas. **Fail:** no inspector at all — it is force-disabled in production builds, so confirm you're on `npm run dev`. If it appears but says _"CopilotKit core not attached"_, something is rendering `<CopilotKitInspector />` without a `core` prop.

**`/custom-look-and-feel/slots`** _(page live but absent from the doc sidebar)_
Three override levels against one chat. **Pass:** level 1 tints the message area; level 2 auto-focuses the input; level 3 shows a custom header, custom layout, and a custom streaming cursor. **Fail:** all three tabs look identical.

**`/custom-look-and-feel/headless-ui`** _(live but absent from the sidebar)_
A chat with zero CopilotKit chrome. **Try:** `What's the weather in London?` **Pass:** messages stream into hand-written bubbles and tool calls still render through the registry. **Fail:** Send does nothing.

**`/custom-look-and-feel/markdown` — Markdown Rendering.** New upstream, tracked 2026-09-21. The `markdownRenderer` slot three ways, all verbatim: a Streamdown `components` map, a class string, and a bare component that replaces the renderer. **Try:** `Reply in markdown with an '## Overview' heading and a link to https://docs.copilotkit.ai.` on each tab. **Pass:** the probe row under the chat shows level 1's anchor carrying `class="my-link"`, `href`, `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and **no** `node` attribute; level 2 restyles the block with Streamdown's own `data-streamdown` markup intact; level 3 shows a `pre` of raw markdown with no `a` or `h2` at all. **Fail:** a `node="[object Object]"` attribute anywhere, level 1 losing `target`/`rel`, or three identical tabs. All three snippets typecheck as published — including the bare component that [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) #3 says most slots reject. See [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) #26.

### Generative UI

**`/generative-ui/your-components/display-only`**
Registering a React component as a tool the agent can render — `useComponent`, no handler, no interaction. **Try:** `Show the weather card for Tokyo: 77 degrees, clear`. **Pass:** a bordered weather card renders inline in the chat with the agent's values. **Fail:** a plain-text answer with no card — the tool wasn't called.

**`/generative-ui/your-components/interactive`** — 🚧 **Intentionally empty.** The upstream doc page is a stub (its whole body is a `<SharedContent />` placeholder), so there's nothing to implement. The route exists to keep the nav and status table complete.

**`/generative-ui/tool-rendering`**
A named renderer for `get_weather` plus a wildcard fallback. **Try:** `What's the weather in Tokyo?` then `What's the price of NVDA?` **Pass:** weather renders the bordered card, transitioning "Checking…" → result; the stock call renders the plain monospace fallback. **Fail:** raw JSON, or nothing.

**`/generative-ui/frontend-cards`** — ✅ **Working**, with a silent-loss finding. New upstream 2026-09-11. A card pushed into the transcript from frontend code as a `role: "activity"` message, which is stripped from every run. **Try:** click **Simulate: deployment finished**, then ask `Have you been shown any deployment card?` **Pass:** the card renders; the probe row reads `agent.messages = activity, user, assistant` and `run payload = user` (read off the request that left the browser); the agent says it saw no card. **Fail:** no card, or `activity` in the payload row. The three snippets are verbatim; step 3's `<DeploymentWatcher />` is mounted inside step 2's provider, which the page never says to do, and its `wss://example.com` socket never delivers, so the button fires the same `addMessage`. See [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) #15.

The A2UI, Open Generative UI, Shared State, HITL overview and Sub-agents routes (added 2026-10-07) run the docs' demo **Code tab** code, copied byte-exact into `<route>/_demo/<demo-id>/` (the bundle's `src/app/demos/<demo-id>/`). Each demo wraps itself in its own `<CopilotKit>`, so the root provider's Inspector stands down on those routes (`lib/inspector.ts`). None has been checked in a browser yet; "backend-checked" means the AG-UI endpoint was driven directly with `curl`.

**`/generative-ui/a2ui/dynamic-schema`** — ⚠️ Partial
A catalog of eight branded components handed to the provider; a secondary LLM designs each surface from it. The published agent's own `generate_a2ui` needs an unpublished `tools` package, so the agent is the published prompt only and the runtime takes the page's auto-inject path (its `a2ui` block is commented out). **Try:** `Show me my sales dashboard for this quarter.` **Pass:** a surface of Metric tiles, a table and a chart. **Fail:** prose (tool not injected) or raw JSON (middleware not running). Backend-checked: the agent calls an injected `generate_a2ui`.

**`/generative-ui/a2ui/fixed-schema`** — ⚠️ Partial
A flight card whose component tree is a JSON file on the backend; `display_flight` supplies only the data. Everything verbatim from the Code tab. **Try:** `Find me a flight from SFO to JFK on United for $289.` **Pass:** card with SFO → JFK, a UNITED badge, Total $289 and a Book button that does nothing (published as inert). **Fail:** blank bound fields — the zod 4 symptom; this repo pins zod 3.25.76. Backend-checked: the tool returns the operations container.

**`/generative-ui/mcp-apps`** — 🚧 **Tracked, not implemented.** Every code sample on the page is a `BuiltInAgent` runtime; there is no Agno code and no embedded demo.

**`/generative-ui/open-generative-ui`** — ⚠️ Partial
The agent writes HTML/CSS/JS into a sandboxed iframe; the demo route has the page's minimal and advanced (host sandbox functions) demos as tabs. Runtime route and frontends verbatim; the Agno agent is never published, so `backend/agents/open_gen_ui_agent.py` is repo-authored (no tools). **Try:** `How a neural network works`; on the Advanced tab, `Calculator (calls evaluateExpression)`. **Pass:** an iframe that builds itself live; the calculator logs `evaluateExpression` in the browser console. **Fail:** a prose answer — which is what the agent gave when offered a stand-in tool outside the runtime, so this one is unverified.

### Shared State

**`/shared-state/rendering-in-app`** — ⚠️ Partial
`useAgent()` in a main-view `Canvas` beside a `CopilotSidebar`. Both snippets verbatim, on this repo's default agent; the page has no demo or backend half. **Try:** load the demo. **Pass:** "Project launch" with two items appears as soon as the agent connects. **Fail:** "Untitled" and an empty list.

**`/shared-state/agent-readonly`** — ⚠️ Partial
`useAgentContext` publishing a name, timezone and activity list to the agent, read-only. Frontend verbatim except a simplified layout and default name `Sarah` (published: `Atai`); the agent is the published `main.py` prompt without its tools (its `tools` package is unpublished). **Try:** `What do you know about me from my context?`, then change the name and ask again. **Pass:** the answer names the current values. **Fail:** the agent says it knows nothing about you. Backend-checked: all three values come back.

### App Control

**`/human-in-the-loop/overview`** — ⚠️ Partial
The HITL overview's two demos as tabs. **hitl-in-chat:** `useHumanInTheLoop` registers `book_call`; a picker renders and the pick is the tool result. **gen-ui-interrupt:** the docs' Agno stand-in for `interrupt()` — the same mechanism as `schedule_meeting`, with a repo-authored `generateFallbackSlots`. **Try:** `Please book an intro call with the sales team to discuss pricing.` on each tab. **Pass:** on hitl-in-chat, pick a slot and the agent confirms that time. **Expected failure:** on gen-ui-interrupt, the pick ends in RUN_ERROR `Frontend tool resume requires a database` — the published agent has no `db` and relied on the docs' custom server route, which cannot import on agno 3.x. Both legs backend-checked.

**`/frontend-tools` — Frontend Tools**
Three tools that run in the browser and change this page. **Try:** `Say hello to Malaika`, `Change the theme to violet`, `Bookmark the CopilotKit docs at https://docs.copilotkit.ai`. **Pass:** each panel updates the moment the call completes; the theme change follows you across every route. **Fail:** the agent claims success but nothing changes — the tool names have drifted apart.

**`/human-in-the-loop/governed-actions` — Governed Action Approval**
An approval checkpoint in front of a side-effecting action, showing the policy verdict and the exact arguments before anything runs. **Try:** `Send an invoice reminder to acme@example.com. Ask me to approve it first.` **Pass:** a card renders with the verdict and the JSON arguments, and the run holds until Approve or Reject. **Fail:** the agent reports the reminder sent with no card.

**`/human-in-the-loop`** _(live but absent from the sidebar)_
**Try:** `Can you show me two good options for a restaurant name?` **Pass:** two buttons render in the message stream and **nothing further streams until you click one**. **Fail:** two options as plain text, or the agent continues without waiting.

**`/webmcp`** — 🚧 **Tracked, not implemented.** The doc adds a `webmcp` flag to a frontend tool so browser agents can discover it. Its own test procedure needs Chrome 149+ with the WebMCP origin trial (or `chrome://flags/#enable-webmcp-testing`) and Chrome's Model Context Tool Inspector; CopilotKit no-ops where `document.modelContext` is absent, so a demo here would register nothing and still look green.

### Multi-Agent

**`/multi-agent/subagents`** — ⚠️ Partial
A supervisor whose tools are research, writing and critique Agno agents; a delegation log renders `delegations` from shared state. Agent and frontend verbatim. **Try:** `Write a short blog post about why cats purr.` **Pass:** three inline activity cards in order, then the log fills with three entries **at the end of the run**. **Fail:** the log stays empty after the run. It never shows a `running` entry: the stock router's per-tool state deltas need `jsonpatch` (`agno[agui]`), which the Quickstart's install line leaves out. Backend-checked: the final snapshot carries all three, `completed`.

### Backend

**`/backend/copilot-runtime`**
Live agent routing between two ids (`default` and `agno_agent`) that resolve to the same process. **Pass:** both stream, and each id keeps its own conversation. **Fail:** one errors with agent-not-found.

**`/backend/ag-ui`**
A live capture of the raw AG-UI event stream, with pause and clear. **Try:** `What's the weather in Tokyo?` **Pass:** `RUN_STARTED` → `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` burst → `TOOL_CALL_START`/`END` → `TOOL_CALL_RESULT` → `RUN_FINISHED`. **Fail:** the log stays empty while the chat streams.

### Troubleshooting

**`/troubleshooting/error-debugging`** — A **live error log** fed by the provider-level `onError`. **Try:** stop the Agno process, send a message. **Pass:** an entry appears with an `agent_run_failed`-style code. **Fail:** silent failure with nothing logged.

**`/status`** — Every route and its status in one table.

### Intelligence

**`/intelligence/memories`** — ❌ **Broken as documented.** New upstream 2026-09-11. **Try:** `Please remember that I prefer concise status updates.`, then **Save**, then switch to the second runtime and **Save** again. **What happens:** on the documented runtime the list reads "Memory is not available for this runtime." and the save 404s — at this repo's runtime, not the platform, because memory routes are off unless the runtime is built with `memory: { access }`, which the page never mentions. On the second runtime (the same one plus that option) the platform answers `403 MEMORY_NOT_ENTITLED`, the hook reports `isAvailable: true`, and the page's `MemoryList` renders an empty list. The page's React snippet itself does not compile — see [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) #16.

**`/learning`** — ⚠️ **Partial.** New upstream 2026-09-11. The page's runtime snippet, verbatim, on its own mount at `/api/copilotkit-learning`. **Try:** on `expense-agent`, `Review this expense: $42 team lunch, receipt attached.`; then on `default`, `Say hello in five words.` **What happens:** `expense-agent` never answers — its Thread is assigned to the page's example container `expense-review`, which does not exist in this project, and the run fails with "Failed to initialize thread" while the chat shows nothing. `default` answers. The dashboard and CLI half of the page (create a container, Run Learning, approve a Skill, `npx copilotkit@latest skills download`) is behind a login and not exercised. See [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) #17.

### Cookbook

**`/cookbook/jev-generative-ui` — Jev: fast generative UI.** ⚠️ **Partial**, and deliberately so. New upstream, tracked 2026-09-21. The recipe has two halves and only one can exist here. **What runs:** the published `lib/workspaces.ts` schemas and the published `app/page.tsx` picker — its form, its panel markup and its two button message formats — all verbatim. **What cannot:** the Jev decision. `lib/choose-panel.ts` needs `@typesafe-ai/sdk` (absent) and a `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` from TypeSafe, a third-party vendor; `lib/picker-agent.ts` needs that plus `@langchain/openai` (absent). Both ship verbatim, imported by nothing, with the unresolvable imports acknowledged in place. **Try:** press **Show the clarification panel**, then **Show the comparison panel**. **Pass:** the published panel markup draws both prepared controls out of `PanelSchema.parse`, the probe row reads `isReady: false` for `useAgent({ agentId: "picker" })`, and pressing **Find options** does nothing — the published `send` returns early on `!isReady`. **Fail:** any panel that claims a Jev decision was made, or a picker that answers a typed request. Nothing here can produce either, and if it did, something would be standing in for the vendor. See [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) #27.

**Legend:** ✅ Working · ⚠️ Partial (blocked by something outside this repo) · 📖 Reference (intentionally not a live feature) · ❌ Broken · 🚧 Not started

Not implemented as routes: `/agno/(other)/telemetry` (a config note, covered by `COPILOTKIT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` in `.env.example`).

**Tracked without a demo.** `/agno/webmcp` carries a route, a nav entry and a snapshot so drift is watched, but nothing is implemented behind it and the recorder does not touch it. The reason is on the route’s page and in §7. The rest of `/agno/intelligence/` (including `/agno/intelligence/quickstart`, whose route was removed on 2026-09-17) is the old `/agno/premium/` set under a new prefix and stays in `doc-snapshot/manifest.json`’s `knownUnmapped` list.

## Doc drift detection

`/doc-sync` keeps this repo honest about the docs it mirrors. Press **Sync docs now** (on the landing page or on `/doc-sync`) and it fetches the markdown source behind all 29 tracked doc pages, diffs each against the copy stored in `doc-snapshot/`, replaces that copy, and reports what moved — ranked by whether the change can actually break an implementation.

Doc pages are fetched by appending `.md` to their URL, which returns the authored MDX rather than 250 KB of rendered HTML. Every response is checked for `text/markdown` before it is allowed near the snapshot: a URL that misses the markdown handler still answers `200` with the HTML app shell, and writing that in would destroy the baseline and report the whole corpus as rewritten on the next run. A run commits all pages or none.

**Severity is decided by where the edit landed**, not how big it was:

| Level      | Trigger                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High**   | a changed line inside a fenced code block, a changed fence count, or a page that now 404s and is gone from the sitemap |
| **Medium** | a changed heading, changed frontmatter `title`/`description`, or prose in the same section as changed code             |
| **Low**    | other prose                                                                                                            |

**Sections checked** lists every tracked page in nav order with a mark — `✓` unchanged, `!` changed, `+` stored, `✗` 404, `~` unstable, `·` not checked. Expanding a row shows the comparison: for a changed page the diff (`−` existing snapshot, `+` newly fetched), and for an unchanged one the two matching hashes, which is the evidence the check ran.

**`doc-snapshot/CHANGELOG.md`** is the record that survives a re-sync. Because syncing replaces the copy it just compared against, the run _after_ a change reports nothing — so the changelog is written at the moment of discovery and never rewritten later. Only changed pages are recorded; a clean run does not touch the file. It keeps the three most recent dated entries, counted rather than aged, so a change from six weeks ago still shows if nothing has happened since.

**One sync date.** `syncedAt` in `doc-snapshot/manifest.json`, rewritten on every run and shown on `/`, `/status` and `/doc-sync`. There is no hand-maintained date to keep in step with it.

**To test it**, edit any `doc-snapshot/pages/*.md` file and press the button — a line inside a code fence for High, a `##` heading for Medium, a sentence for Low. The comparison reads the stored file itself, so nothing else needs changing. Both `/doc-sync` and the changelog label the result as a local snapshot edit rather than upstream drift.

Commit `doc-snapshot/` — `pages/`, `manifest.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` are the baseline every diff is taken against. `reports/` is gitignored derived data.

```

The nav, every route header, the demo links, and the status table above all derive from `frontend/src/lib/nav-config.ts`, so a route's status is stated once.

### Autorecorder

`autorecorder/` produces one demo video per doc page: it opens the live doc page
and scrolls it, switches to a simulated VS Code showing **this repo's own source**
for that feature, then switches to the browser and drives the real demo route.
It is a portable folder shared across CopilotKit framework repos and is adapted
here for Agno — `autorecorder/config/` and `autorecorder/actions/` hold everything
Agno-specific; `autorecorder/core/` is shared and must not be edited.

Both services must be running first, because a video of a dead page is worse than
no video — the recorder refuses to start otherwise.

```bash
cd autorecorder
npm install && npx playwright install chromium

npm run doctor            # static: config, files, line ranges, handlers
npm run doctor:online     # also probes every demo route, doc URL, and selector
npm run record -- --list  # what will be recorded
npm run record            # all 18, in nav order
npm run manifest          # record what was produced — run this after every recording
```

Output lands in `autorecorder/videos/` as `AGNO-react-<NN>-<Name>.webm`, numbered
in nav order. **The clips are gitignored on purpose** (by `autorecorder/videos/.gitignore`)
— recordings are build output, reproducible from the folder, and committing them
bloats history badly. Publish them as release assets instead.

`npm run doctor` exiting 0 is the definition of a working configuration; it is
what catches an IDE line range that drifted after someone edited a demo page.

**Tracking which clips are current.** Since the videos are not versioned and each
run overwrites the same filenames, `npm run manifest` writes
`autorecorder/videos/manifest.json` and `MANIFEST.md` — ~12KB of committed text
recording, per clip, when it was made and whether the source it demonstrates has
changed since. Those two files are the QA record for the recordings, the way the
table in §8 is for the routes: commit them, and the diff shows what each run
changed. `npm run manifest:check` exits 1 if any clip is stale or missing. Note it
tracks freshness, not correctness — a failed run still writes a video.

**Only the 16 routes with a `demo-chat` page are recorded.** The five reference
routes — `/`, `/threads`, `/threads/import`, `/threads/architecture`, and
`/generative-ui/your-components/interactive` — have nothing to drive, and the
recorder has no way to register a page without a demo URL. See
[`autorecorder/README.md`](autorecorder/README.md#scope-in-this-repo).

Two cold-start effects, one handled and one not. The **frontend** kind is
absorbed: a dev server compiles page chunks lazily and API routes on first
request, so the recorder waits for the demo route to settle and warms
`/api/copilotkit` before typing anything — without that, a prompt goes into an
input nothing is wired to yet. The **agent** kind is not: the first model call
after starting the backend can take ~60s, longer than the recorder's 30s response
window, so it fails that page. Send one message in the app by hand — or record a
single page first — before running the full suite.
