/**
 * Deliberately NOT routed through the shared sendPrompt() helper.
 *
 * This page hand-builds its input and Send button over useAgent/useCopilotKit,
 * and its submit path is timing-sensitive in a way the shared helper breaks:
 * switching it over made the run fail reproducibly with
 * `agent_run_error_event HTTP 405` from the Python backend and no response at
 * all, while this implementation streams reliably. The difference does not
 * reproduce headlessly, so the exact trigger is not pinned down yet.
 *
 * ── The composer used to be unreachable ────────────────────────────────────
 * The input and Send button share one flex row at the bottom of the chat
 * column. While that column was `h-full`, the row sat at roughly y=1026..1064
 * at 1080p -- underneath the simulated taskbar, which owns the bottom 48px and
 * swallows clicks. A real click never landed, focus never moved, every typed
 * character went nowhere, and the clip showed an empty box. This handler worked
 * around it by gliding the cursor for the camera and setting focus
 * programmatically, then submitting via Enter because Send was buried too.
 *
 * The demo page now centres the chat panel instead, so the composer sits around
 * y=737 with ~300px of clearance. Both controls are genuinely clickable, so the
 * recording drives them the way a person would -- which is the point of the
 * clip. The programmatic focus survives only as a fallback, because a workaround
 * that silently covers for a regression is how the overlap went unnoticed the
 * first time.
