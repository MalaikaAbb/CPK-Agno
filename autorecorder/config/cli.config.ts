/**

 *  ADAPT THIS FILE — 4 of 4
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * This framework's command-line flows: the scaffolding CLI and the installs
 * that follow it, each driven through a real terminal and captured to a cast
 * file that the recorder later replays on camera.
 *
 * Adapting means rewriting the prompts below to match *this* framework's CLI.
 * Every CopilotKit repo runs the same `copilotkit create`, but the answers
 * differ — the framework row, the Intelligence project, whether a chat-channel
 * prompt appears at all — and some frameworks' quickstarts use a different tool
 * entirely.
 *
 * ── The one rule ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Name rows, do not count them. `select: { label: '...' }` walks the list until
 * the highlight is on that row. The alternative — "press Down sixteen times" —
 * works until the CLI adds a menu entry, and then it scaffolds the wrong
 * framework while reporting success. The framework list has 23 entries today
 * and grows with every integration CopilotKit ships.
 *
 * ── Before the first run ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `npm run capture -- --login` once. Sign-in opens a browser and cannot be
 * automated; doing it up front turns the mid-run auth pause into a precondition
 * and makes everything after it deterministic.
 *
 * ── Status of the prompts encoded here ─────────────────────────────────────
 * PREDICTED, not observed. The real CLI has never been run in this repo. Every
 * step below is carried over from the reference implementation's real Microsoft
 * Agent Framework (Python) run, adjusted for what
 * `npx copilotkit@latest framework list` reports about `agno` — it accepts
 * `-i`, `--mock` and `--channel`, so the Intelligence and chat-platform prompts
 * both apply here, and it reads `OPENAI_API_KEY`. `1-cli-testing/CLI-FLOW.md`
 * says which steps are predicted and which are confirmed; update both files
 * from the first real run.

/**
 * The deliverable: three videos per package manager, twelve in all.
 *
 * Each manager gets a complete set — the CLI creating the project, that
 * manager installing it, and its copy running and answering — so one folder of
 * clips tells the whole story for one manager without cross-referencing.
 *
 * The CLI clip is deliberately the same footage in all four sets: the CLI runs
 * once and the result is copied, so there is only one real create to show.
 * `cli-render.ts` records it once and copies the file, rather than re-filming
 * identical footage four times.
 *
 * The third video of each set is a page recording, in `pages.config.ts`.

/**
 * The deliverable: one CLI clip, then two clips per package manager.
 *
 *   1. `CLI-Create`        the CLI scaffolding the app — once, shared by all
 *                          four, because the CLI ran once and the result was
 *                          copied; four clips of it would be the same footage
 *   2. `<pm>-2-Install`    that manager installing the copy, pass or fail —
 *                          this is the clip that shows whether the install
 *                          command works, so it is always filmed
 *   3. `<pm>-3-Demo`       the app running and answering a prompt, when the
 *                          install succeeded (a page recording, see
 *                          `pages.config.ts`)
 *      `<pm>-3-Finding`    the failure explained, when it did not: the doc
 *                          page, the versions it resolved, the manifest line,
 *                          the command failing, and a note written out
 *
 * Which of the two third clips a manager gets is decided by its install
 * report, not by hand: `npm run cli:videos` reads `casts/*.report.json` and
 * films the finding for a failed install or records the demo for a working
 * one. A failure nobody has analysed yet still gets a clip — the note is
 * generated from the report (command, exit code, last screen) and the
 * hand-written `analysis` below is appended when there is one.
 *
 * `../REPOS.md`: a broken thing keeps its broken implementation and
 * the recording exists to show the defect; every finding pins installed
 * against declared versions. That is what the finding clip's IDE tabs are.
