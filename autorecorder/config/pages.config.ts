/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  ADAPT THIS FILE — 3 of 3
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * One entry per doc page, in the order the project owner wants the clips
 * numbered: Basics, Custom Look and Feel, Human in the Loop, Generative UI,
 * App Control, Threads, Backend, then the pages that are not filmed. Position
 * here is the NN in each filename, so moving an entry renumbers its clip.
 *
 * Entries are deliberately short. `docUrl`, `demoUrl` and the output filename
 * are derived from `project.config.ts` plus the fields below, so no entry can
 * point at the wrong framework's docs and filenames stay in nav order without
 * anyone numbering them by hand.
 *
 * Adapting means: delete the pages this framework does not document, add the
 * ones it does, and fix the line ranges. `npm run doctor` then tells you which
 * ranges no longer point at real code.
 *
 * ── Scope, for this repo ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `route` + `demoSuffix` is the only demo URL a page can have, and the doctor
 * errors on any that is not 200. Some doc routes have no `demo-chat` page and
 * are deliberately absent below rather than registered and broken: `/`,
 * `/threads`, `/threads/import` and `/threads/architecture` are reference
 * material, and `/webmcp` is tracked for drift with nothing implemented behind
 * it (see the README's §8).
 * `/generative-ui/your-components/interactive` also has no demo but *is*
 * registered, as a `docOnly` take — the upstream page is a stub, so the clip
 * shows the doc and this repo's source for it. See the repo README's
 * autorecorder section.
 *
 * Everything here mirrors `frontend/src/lib/nav-config.ts`, which is the app's
 * single source of truth for route -> doc-page mapping. `docPath` is that
 * file's `docPath` minus its leading `/agno`.
 *
 * ── The line ranges ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `startLine`/`endLine` are what the simulated IDE highlights. They are
 * hardcoded, which means they drift the moment someone edits a demo page.
 * Doctor guards this: where a file carries `[!code highlight]` or `#region`
 * markers, it checks the range still covers one and names the marker's current
 * line when it does not. Keep those markers in the frontend and the guard keeps
 * working. (Note the counted form, `[!code highlight:10]`, is not a marker the
 * doctor recognises, so files carrying only that form are unguarded.)

/**
 * The scaffolded app, running — video 3 of each package manager's set.
 *
 * The other two are the CLI creating the project and that manager installing
 * it, both in `config/cli.config.ts`. This one is the payoff, and it is a
 * recording of the real app rather than a re-enactment: the dev server filmed
 * booting in the terminal is the same process that serves the page driven
 * immediately afterwards.
 *
 * The order on screen is how someone would actually check a fresh scaffold:
 *
 *   1. the doc page that told them to run the CLI
 *   2. `package.json` — what the starter declares
 *   3. the lockfile — what this manager actually resolved, pinned
 *   4. the app's own CopilotKit code, so the chat below has a source
 *   5. `<pm> run dev` booting, in a terminal
 *   6. the app open in a browser, asked a question, answering
 *
 * Steps 2 and 3 are the pair that matters. `package.json` carries RANGES, so on
 * its own it cannot answer "which versions is this?" — and the resolved set is
 * exactly where four package managers can differ. The lockfile is where that
 * difference is written down, which is why this tab is a different file in each
 * set.
 *
 * These four are appended LAST in `definePages`, after every doc page, so the
 * matrix takes the highest order numbers and no existing page's filename index
 * moves when they are added or removed.
 *
 * ── Ports ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 3011–3014, and neither 3000/3010 nor 3121–3124.
 *
 * Not 3010 (this repo's own frontend) or 3000 (other apps), and a recording that
 * quietly used *that* would look like a pass while proving nothing about the
 * scaffold. Not 3121–3124 either, and that is not superstition: this block
 * ships to every framework repo, so every copy that keeps the reference's
 * numbers picks the same ports — and a sibling repo's scaffold left running on
 * one of them is enough for the dev server here to fail with EADDRINUSE while
 * the browser happily records *that other framework's app*. Each repo gets its
 * own range; this one is Agno's.
 *
 * ── The starter this records ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Agno is a Python-agent starter. Its `dev` script is
 *
 *   npm run dev:infra && concurrently "npm run dev:ui" "npm run dev:agent" \
 *     --names ui,agent --prefix-colors blue,green --kill-others
 *
 * so three things share one terminal: an env-var pre-check, `next dev` (Next
 * 16, no `--turbopack` flag), and the `uv`-run Python agent. `readyPattern`
 * therefore has to pick the UI's ready line out of interleaved output that
 * concurrently prefixes with `[ui] ` / `[agent] `. It is matched unanchored
 * against the terminal buffer, so the prefix sits harmlessly in front of it.
 *
 * `readyPattern` is UNVERIFIED against a real boot — the pipeline has not been
 * run in this repo — and it is read off `1-cli-testing/yarn/app/package.json`
 * plus what Next 16 prints when it binds. If a future starter changes that
 * wording the recorder waits out the timeout and reports that the server never
 * started, which is the right failure: it never became reachable in a way this
 * config recognises.
