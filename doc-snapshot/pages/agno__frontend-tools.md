## What is this?
Frontend tools enable you to define client-side functions that your Agno agent can invoke, with execution happening entirely in the user's browser. When your agent calls a frontend tool,
the logic runs on the client side, giving you direct access to the frontend environment.

This can be utilized for to let [your agent control the UI](/agno/frontend-tools), [generative UI](/agno/frontend-tools), or for [Human-in-the-loop](/agno/human-in-the-loop) interactions.

In this guide, we cover the use of frontend tools driving and interacting with the UI.

## When should I use this?
Use frontend tools when you need your agent to interact with client-side primitives such as:
- Reading or modifying React component state
- Accessing browser APIs like localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies
- Triggering UI updates or animations
- Interacting with third-party frontend libraries
- Performing actions that require the user's immediate browser context

## Implementation

<Callout type="warn" title="Configure session storage">
  Agno must store the paused run before a frontend tool can return its result.
  Configure a database on the `Agent` that owns the external tool.

  Install the SQLite dependency:

  ```bash
  pip install sqlalchemy
  ```

  Use a project-relative SQLite file for local development:

  ```python
  from agno.agent import Agent
  from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb

  db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agno.db")

  agent = Agent(
      # ...
      db=db,
  )
  ```

  The deployed showcase uses `/tmp/agno.db` because its application directory
  is read-only to the runtime user.

  For production, use durable shared storage such as `PgDb`. An ephemeral
  container file cannot resume a run on another instance.
</Callout>

        ### Run and connect your agent
       You'll need to run your agent and connect it to CopilotKit before proceeding. If you haven't done so already,
you can follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](/langgraph/quickstart) guide.

If you don't already have an agent, you can use the [coagent starter](https://github.com/copilotkit/copilotkit/tree/main/examples/coagents-starter) as a starting point
as this guide uses it as a starting point.

    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Create a frontend tool

        First, you'll need to create a frontend tool using the [useFrontendTool](/reference/v1/hooks/useFrontendTool) hook. Here's a simple one to get you started
        that says hello to the user.

        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
        import { z } from "zod";
        import { useFrontendTool } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2" // [!code highlight]

        export function Page() {
          // ...

          {/* [!code highlight:12] */}
          useFrontendTool({
            name: "sayHello",
            description: "Say hello to the user",
            parameters: z.object({
              name: z.string().describe("The name of the user to say hello to"),
            }),
            handler: async ({ name }) => {
              alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
              return `Said hello to ${name}!`;
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Define the frontend tool in your Agno agent

        Now, we'll need to modify the agent to access these frontend tools.

        In your Agno agent, define a tool with the `@tool(external_execution=True)` decorator. This tells Agno that the tool will be executed externally (on the frontend).

        ```python title="tools/frontend.py"
        from agno.tools import tool

        @tool(external_execution=True)
        def sayHello(name: str):
            """
            Say hello to the user.

            Args:
                name: The name of the user to say hello to
            """
        ```

        Register the tool with your agent:

        ```python title="agent.py"
        from agno.agent import Agent
        from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
        from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
        from agno.os import AgentOS
        from agno.os.interfaces.agui import AGUI
        from tools.frontend import sayHello

        db = SqliteDb(db_file="tmp/agno.db")

        agent = Agent(
            model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-5.4"),
            tools=[sayHello],
            db=db,
            description="A helpful assistant that can answer questions and provide information.",
            instructions="Be helpful and friendly. Format your responses using markdown where appropriate.",
        )

        agent_os = AgentOS(agents=[agent], interfaces=[AGUI(agent=agent)])
        app = agent_os.get_app()
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        You've now given your agent the ability to directly call any frontend tools you've defined. These tools will be available to the agent where they can be used as needed.
