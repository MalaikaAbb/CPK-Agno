/**
 * Jev: fast generative UI, step 4 — the runtime registration, verbatim.
 * NOTHING IMPORTS THIS FILE, and it is deliberately NOT under `app/api/`.
 *
 * The page titles it `app/api/copilotkit/[[...slug]]/route.ts`. Put there it
 * would collide with this repo's own runtime at that exact path, and it would
 * register a `picker` agent whose every turn throws inside `choosePanel` for
 * want of a vendor SDK and a Jev key. So it is kept outside the route tree: the
 * point of the file is that it compiles, not that it serves.
 *
 * And it does compile, on the then-installed `@copilotkit/runtime` 1.72.0
 * (declared `^1.69.2`), against the page's pinned `@copilotkit/runtime@1.73.0`;
 * it still does on 1.73.3 (declared `^1.73.3`, 2026-09-23). Together
 * with `picker-agent.ts` and the React page, that is the whole published stack
 * typechecking one minor version below the pin, with the page giving no reason
 * for it.
 *
 * Worth noting against this repo's §9 #18: this file is titled with the
 * catch-all path, `[[...slug]]`, and exports GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE —
 * agreeing with Quickstart, Copilot Runtime and Thread & History Lifecycle, and
 * disagreeing with the /agno landing page's plain `app/api/copilotkit/route.ts`
 * with two exports. Four pages to one.
