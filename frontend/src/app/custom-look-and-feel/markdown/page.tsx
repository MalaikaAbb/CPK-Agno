          Assistant replies arrive as markdown, and CopilotKit renders them
          through the <code>markdownRenderer</code> slot on{" "}
          <code>CopilotChatAssistantMessage</code>, whose default wraps
          Streamdown. The demo tabs the page&apos;s three techniques against one
          chat: a Streamdown <code>components</code> map, a class string, and a
          component that replaces the renderer and receives one{" "}
          <code>content</code> prop. All three snippets are verbatim.

          about the props an override receives are all attribute-level, so they

      <Callout tone="success" title="Verified: a bare component IS assignable to this slot">
        This repo&apos;s §9 #3 records that a plain function component is not
        assignable to most slots, because{" "}
        <code>SlotValue&lt;C&gt; = C | string | Partial&lt;ComponentProps&lt;C&gt;&gt;</code>{" "}
        forces a replacement to match the default component&apos;s type,
        attached statics included. &ldquo;Replace the renderer&rdquo; passes a
        bare <code>PlainText</code>, and it typechecks here:{" "}
        <code>MarkdownRenderer</code> is a plain <code>React.FC</code> in the{" "}
        <code>CopilotChatAssistantMessage</code> namespace with no statics of its
        own, and its props are a supertype of <code>{"{ content: string }"}</code>,
        so the assignment is ordinary contravariance. Checked with{" "}
        <code>npx tsc --noEmit</code> on the installed{" "}
        <strong>@copilotkit/react-core 1.72.0</strong> (declared{" "}
        <code>^1.69.2</code>), and again on 1.73.3 (declared{" "}
        <code>^1.73.3</code>). So #3 is about which slots, not about slots in
        general, and this page happens to land on the safe side.

      <Callout tone="success" title="Verified: the custom-tag compile error is exactly what the page prints">
        The page says a custom key is a compile error and quotes the message.
        The smallest reproduction of it lives in{" "}
        <code>custom-tag-probe.tsx</code>, imported by nothing, and the message
        matched the published text character for character. It is kept as a{" "}
        <code>@ts-expect-error</code> so the claim stays under the typecheck: if
        a release ever starts accepting custom keys, the suppression goes unused
        and this repo&apos;s <code>npx tsc --noEmit</code> fails.

        is worth knowing, because the sentence next to it (&ldquo;you are
        replacing, not extending&rdquo;) could be read as meaning you lose the
        hardening too. You do not: the hardening is a rehype plugin that writes
        the attributes onto the parsed node before any component mapping, so
        your override receives them and spreading keeps them. What you lose by
        replacing is only what the default <em>component</em> adds — the
        Streamdown classes and <code>data-streamdown</code>. Streamdown&apos;s
        own default anchor sets the weaker <code>rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;</code>{" "}
        and is then overwritten by the hardened pair.{" "}
        <strong>Static read only</strong>: no server was started in this pass, so
        the attributes have not been observed in a running page. The demo&apos;s
        probe row is where that gets checked.

      <Callout tone="warn" title="One unstated prerequisite: the components map is Streamdown's, and Streamdown is not a declared dependency">
        The <code>components</code> override is Streamdown&apos;s prop, and the
        page links to streamdown.ai for it, but it never says which Streamdown
        the slot forwards to or that the map&apos;s keys and prop shapes are that
        package&apos;s API rather than CopilotKit&apos;s. Here{" "}
        <strong>streamdown 1.6.11</strong> arrives only as a transitive
        dependency of <code>@copilotkit/react-core</code> (which declares{" "}
        <code>^1.3.0</code>), so the type a reader is writing against can move
        under a caret range they never wrote down. Nothing needed installing for
        this page, which is the upside; nothing pins it either.
