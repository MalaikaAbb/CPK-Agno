          Tools the agent calls that execute in the user&apos;s browser rather
          than in the agent process. The handler runs client-side, so it can
          touch React state, browser APIs, and anything else only the frontend
          has access to — then returns a string the model reads as the tool
          result.

      <Callout tone="warn" title="Why these are registered globally">
        The docs register frontend tools on the page that uses them. This repo
        registers all four at the app root instead. The Agno agent declares every
        tool on <em>every</em> conversation, so a chat on any route can call one
        — and a tool call with no registered handler never returns a result,
        which leaves the run hanging forever. Page-scoped registration would let
        every other route deadlock its own chat.
