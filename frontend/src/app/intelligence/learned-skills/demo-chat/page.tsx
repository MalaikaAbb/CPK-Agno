/**
 * Skill delivery, against this repo's Agno agent.
 *
 * There is no adapter to mount. The page is published under /agno and Agno is
 * not in its adapter table at all; the generic Python client it names,
 * `copilotkit-intelligence-runtime`, is not on PyPI either. So there is nothing
 * to attach to the agent, and the two tools the page reserves never exist.
 *
 * The 2026-09-21 sync added a BuiltInAgent row, which needs no adapter package.
 * Its `learnedSkills` option typechecks on runtime 1.73.3 (it failed on 1.72.0;
 * see `../built-in-agent.ts`), but it is not mounted here: a BuiltInAgent
 * would replace the Agno agent this section is about.
 *
 * The demo shows the absence rather than faking the presence: the agent is
 * this repo's normal `agno_agent`, and the prompt asks for the exact tool
 * names the page reserves. The agent answers from its own instructions with no
 * tool call, which is what a reader following the page ends up with.
 *
 * The tool names below are quoted from the page's "Read tools" section. They
 * are listed as text, not registered — registering look-alike tools would make
 * the page appear to work and destroy the finding.
