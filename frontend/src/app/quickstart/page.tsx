              One deliberate difference from the doc sample: a second agent id,
              so the Copilot Runtime route can demonstrate routing against a
              real second registration.

            The doc's route now wires <code>CopilotKitIntelligence</code> and{" "}
            <code>identifyUser</code> using the project key from step 1. An
            earlier sync renamed it to <code>CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY</code> and
            stopped calling it a license key, with the placeholder going from{" "}
            <code>your_license_key</code> to <code>cpk-...</code>. This route
            does the same when either spelling is set, and otherwise takes the
            fallback the doc describes: SSE with an in-memory runner, so chat
            works while Threads and the Inspector stay locked.

            The 2026-09-21 sync stopped telling you to write the key by hand.

            cloud-hosted setup &ldquo;does not issue{" "}
            <code>COPILOTKIT_LICENSE_TOKEN</code>&rdquo;; the runtime step now
            runs <code>npx copilotkit@latest project select</code> from the
            frontend app directory, which &ldquo;writes the server-side project
            API key to <code>.env</code>&rdquo;. The env block it shows is
            titled <code>.env</code>, where every earlier revision said{" "}
            <code>.env.local</code>. Nothing on the page acknowledges the move,
            and nothing says what happens to a reader who already has the key in{" "}
            <code>.env.local</code>: Next.js reads both, and{" "}
            <code>.env.local</code> wins, so a stale value there silently
            outranks the one the CLI just wrote. This repo keeps its own key in{" "}
            <code>frontend/.env.local</code>, which is what its README documents.

            <code>/api/copilotkit</code> resolves because Next.js serves both
            the app and the runtime from one origin. A client-only frontend has
            no shared origin and needs a standalone runtime server plus an
            absolute URL.
