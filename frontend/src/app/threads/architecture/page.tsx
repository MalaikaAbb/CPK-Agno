        This page explains the server-side model that the drawer and headless
        routes both sit on. There is nothing interactive to exercise without a
        licensed platform behind it.

        <code>/agno/premium/threads-explained</code>. Both URLs still return{" "}
        <strong>200 with byte-identical markdown</strong>, so the move is
        invisible to a drift check pinned to the old path — no 404, no hash
        change, nothing to report. This repo tracked the old path until this
        sync and would have gone on reporting &ldquo;no drift&rdquo; however far
        the two copies diverged. The snapshot now follows the new path; the
        duplicate is the finding.

        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300">
          A <strong>thread</strong> is the durable container; a <strong>run</strong>{" "}
          is one agent execution inside it. Sending a message starts a new run,
          and the thread accumulates events across all of them. That is why the
          store is a growing event log rather than a message array.

          The runtime writes each event as it happens — messages, tool calls,
          state updates — storing the raw stream rather than a final snapshot. A
          returning client can therefore be restored exactly where it left off,
          and can fetch only the events it missed instead of reloading
          everything.

            <strong>Auto-naming.</strong> After the first run completes, the
            runtime asks the model for a 2–5 word name. It runs asynchronously,
