        Import moves existing conversations into a licensed Enterprise
        Intelligence project. There is no such project here, and the documented
        sources are Google ADK and LangGraph — neither of which this Agno repo
        has history in. Running it would have nothing to read and nowhere to
        write, so this route documents the operation rather than performing it.

      <Panel title="What import is for">
        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300">
          Threads only start capturing conversations once an app is connected to
          the platform. Anything that happened before that — or in a framework&apos;s
          own session store — is invisible to the thread list. Import backfills
          that history into the same store so users can resume old and new
          conversations through one UI.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300">
          Native storage stays where it is. Import copies history into the thread
          store for the Rich Threads experience; runs that were already going
          through native durable persistence continue to do so.

          Always start with <code>--dry-run</code>. It reports what would be
          imported without writing anything, which is the only safe way to check
          the scope before backfilling a real project.

      <Callout tone="warn" title="Half the env vars got renamed">
        This sync changed the importer&apos;s exported key to{" "}
        <code>CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY</code> but left{" "}
        <code>INTELLIGENCE_API_URL</code> on the line above it untouched, so the
        page now asks you to export one prefixed variable and one unprefixed one
        for the same credential pair. Nothing says whether the URL variable was
        missed or is deliberately unprefixed.

      <Callout tone="warn" title="The example key changed shape without a word">
        The sample value went from <code>cpk_...</code> to <code>cpk-...</code>{" "}
        — underscore to hyphen. Elsewhere the docs describe &ldquo;a
        project-scoped <code>cpk</code> runtime key&rdquo; without pinning the
        separator. One of the two spellings is wrong and the page does not say
        which, so a reader hand-typing the key has a coin flip.
