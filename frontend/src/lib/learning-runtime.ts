/**
 * Learning, step "Assign Threads from your Runtime" — the page's runtime,
 * mounted on its own route at `/api/copilotkit-learning`.
 *
 * The snippet below the rule is verbatim. It uses two identifiers it never
 * defines, `agents` and `identifyUser`, and says nothing about them; the page
 * is identical under every framework prefix, so it cannot. They are supplied
 * here, above the rule, and they are this harness's, not the page's:
 *
 *   agents        The Agno agent under the id the page's selector tests for,
 *                 `expense-agent`, plus `default`, which the selector sends to
 *                 no container. One backend, two ids: which one a run uses is
 *                 the only thing that decides whether it is assigned.
 *   identifyUser  The same fixed demo identity the threads runtime uses.
 *
 * A separate mount rather than an edit to `/api/copilotkit`, for two reasons.
 * `getLearningContainerId` exists only from runtime 1.70 — the page names no
 * version — and the constructor throws on a blank key, so the page's code
 * belongs where a failure takes down one route and not every chat in the app.
